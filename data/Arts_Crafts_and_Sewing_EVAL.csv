Great for use in toner transfer operation.,"I am using this to help in toner transfer processes for PCB making. SO I'm probably putting more pressure on it than it is really designed for.

So enjoy being able to get my hands on a Viper.,"If you're a fan of Battlestar Galatica, the first and only BSG, then you'll love these Vipers. The fit, feel and look is spot on. I would have like however to have been able to open the cockpit, and/or have had a figure in there. I mean come on for the money it would have been easy. I had sold off my Jack's Vipers many years back and regretted that day until being able to get these. The weight is on the upper side compared to those, but the build quality is much improved. I really like how the Jack's Viper had a figure and a cockpit that was able to open, as well as other aspects, but these are nicer in a way all there own. As for me as far as I'm concerned there was only one Battlestar Galatica series, and I follow the line of and attitude of what the real Starbuck had to say, wish they would have stayed truer to the original series.",5.0,1606462871944,Battlestar Galactica Collection #5 Base Ship (Classic Series),"Arts, Crafts & Sewing, Model & Hobby Building, Pre-Built & Diecast Models, Spacecraft"

Nice set for magnetizing jewelry - some magnets may not be strong enough.,"I‚Äôve purchased 2 sets of this item and I find they generally work well. I especially like the longer ‚Äúbarrel‚Äù shaped magnet pieces as they are great for extending a necklace. I find the magnets on this design are relatively strong although not as strong as some of the similar devices I‚Äôve used over the years. The ‚Äúrose‚Äù design magnets are pretty and work fine on lighter pieces of jewelry. However, they do not hold moderate to heavy pieces and I‚Äôve had to change them out with other magnetic pieces from other vendors. I have not yet used the ‚Äúpearl‚Äù design pieces so I don‚Äôt know how strong they are. If I were to wear them with pearl jewelry I would be careful as pearls are relatively heavy.",5.0,1666644179972,"16 Pieces Magnetic Necklace Clasps and Closures Magnetic Clasps for Jewelry Making Variety Lobster Claw Clasp Bracelet Necklace Extenders Round Artificial Pearl Locking Clasp, Silver and Gold","Arts, Crafts & Sewing, Beading & Jewelry Making, Jewelry Findings, Jewelry Clasps"

"Amazing stuff, can be used to make flat molds for resin.","This is really fun to use as a substitute for any material that you want to use to make a mold from. it's easy, it's clean and it hardens fast. Put it in hot water, it turns from opaque white to completely clear when it's pliable and you can press an object into it that you want an imprint of and let it cool and harden. I pressed a 1"" flat, heart-shaped piece of wood into it, let it harden a bit, but not so much that I couldn't get the heart out.

Follow video directions and it works great!  Do not shake can!,"I have to say I am extremely impressed with this product. I have cushions that I only purchased last year and other than the fading still look new. I purchased 1 can at local store to try out to see if I liked it.

Sizes are wrong but pretty beads.,"It seems that the gemstone beads that come from China such as Cheavian, Qiwan, and Yochus, have their sizes wrong.

I just wanted to let others know that so they don't waste their time ordering the wrong size. I bought many 6mm beads from these 3 companies and they always came as 4mm. So order one size up if you want 6mm beads. As far as the look of the beads I can't complain. There are no cracks and they are smooth and nicely polished. That is why I still give them 3 stars.

Not satisfied.  Does not behave like beeswax in lotion.,"-Smelled strongly of nag champa, both the package and the wax itself. Did Not smell like beeswax. I am not a fan of Nag champa so this is not for me. -Did not behave as beeswax normally does in my lotion formulas. No other ingredients changed so it was the wax. It had kind of a weird day Glo yellow color, not the usual nice yellow honey color of beeswax. The lotion did not emulsify properly and was grainy. - Bars were of uneven size, beeswax had clearly spilled out of the mold, some were twice the size of others so you would not be able to use the chunks of beeswax as an accurate one ounce measurement for a recipe. A used one chunk which is all I usually need for a recipe and the lotion did not emulsify properly, I then added one more chunk and then another one and the lotion did not thicken any further but remains runny.

Would be more stable if the dowels were longer.,"I like these thread holders because for the price, they are the best option out there.

Cost less if you buy from a different Amazon listing of the same item.,"My daughter and I were trying to decide between two listings on Amazon that are both for Reeves Watercolor Paint of 18 color set. This item is listed for $14.96, while the other is for $8.89, as of April 17, 2015. The photo of this listing shows the tubes of the watercolor paints to be more like ;zinc ; or some kind of metal tubes, with printed paper wrapped around them. This is what I'm used to use when I was a kid. The other listing has 2 inconsistent photos. One looks similar to this photo, but a 2nd photo shows the tubes are entirely made of plastic with the labels printed. Given the inconsistency of the other listing, we thought this would be more trustworthy and decided to buy this item, despite that it costs more. Turns out all the tubes are made of plastic and they look exactly the same as the 2nd photo in the other listing. If we knew this is what we would get, we would have gone with the other listing. I cannot be sure that the quality of the watercolor paint is identical between these 2 listings.

I don't know if the seller does this for all of their cards but this is an old-school courtesy that I can really appreciate.

Overall a good buy (if you catch it on Prime when the price is lower).,"Foam is not cheap and decent foam is even less cheap so overall this is a pretty good price b/c I got it for $27.21 just a week ago and now it is $54 (no idea why prices vary so much from one week to the next). The cut is a bit of a problem b/c it is just under 24 ; and my project needs exactly 24 ; to match the lumber. I have let it set out for 3 days to ensure it decompressed as much as it could. It does feel high density to me and I do not feel the wood when sitting on it. (I am an average sized person) I plan to make a 2' x 4' chaise section and then 2 breakfast bar stools (once I figure out my size I want) I haven't tried to cut it yet but usually a good size serrated bread knife does great w/ foam. It was packed great in its little teeny box (always amazed at how small that stuff can get). I ordered this b/c it was on prime on 20 Aug, so there was no extra shipping, arrived 24 Aug. I thought it was coming on Saturday so I would have been able to work on this on the weekend....but then it wasn't here so I moved onto other things. I will do it this weekend.

Actually pretty cool! Glows after you charge it in light for a couple of minutes.,"This glow in the dark paint far exceeded my expectations. My daughter used it to somewhat quickly paint a few different colored flowers. I let it dry for a few minutes a couple feet below an LED light bulb. Glow in the dark stuff needs to store energy or it will have nothing to luminesce. I took photos of the painting - it's in a kinda-dark but nowhere near pitch black room (there's even a night light on behind), and I only let it charge a few minutes - and to be honest the effect is really good. My daughter noted one possible negative: the colors as painted do not always look much like the colors will luminesce. The bottles are clearly labeled what to expect, and those labels are accurate. BUT, for example, the green in the painting is stark but in a bright room you don't really see much color. (You could always paint this over a base of the color with standard paint, too.)

Nice set of beginner tools with better than most cutting edges.,"Been carving over 45 years since a Boy Scout. If you want perfection buy the 3 cherries German tools...

They fit good in the hand and holds a nice cutting edge through an average small sized project. For the price I am impressed for coming off shore and eastern steel. I also bought another set with more gouges and the edges were horrible and wouldn't take an edge. Remember in any factory there are apprentices and masters. If yours were honed by an apprentice then put some effort to tune the edges and see if they hold. I'm going to take them to the grinding wheel and try to properly tune them so they accept a hand stone to make them work. With any knife, make the effort to put a honed edge on it then pause when needed from your work to keep the edge in shape before it dulls out and you have to start over. Nice inexpensive beginner set. Wear gloves or finger and thumb guards especially with duller edges on any knife.

I don't know if it's the pigment or what, but it leaves a beautiful smooth coating that is very durable and dry to the touch in 10 minutes. It shrinks as it dries and preserves the smallest details underneath. It's so good I am going back and stripping previously primed minis in order to reprime with this black.",5.0,1600749658443,"Vallejo Black Primer Acrylic Polyurethane, 60ml","Arts, Crafts & Sewing, Model & Hobby Building, Accessories, Hardware & Tools, Paints"

I have used all major brands and this is the best for me.,WHY is this the only brand other than mettler that my Janome machine likes consistently and I get great sew outs with this. I tried Floriani when it was oh sale .... mistake. Same pattern and same tention settings and I get LOOPS on top of my finished design ... ugly and a fail especially when you have a client. I think its the fact that floriani puts some sort of lube on their thread and you have to adjust your top tention accordingly to get the sew out correct and professional. Tired of playing games with floriani everytime I do a project. Maybe it works for you ... good! Madeira is inconsistent. Some spools produce excellent results and some spools do not as they appear not to be a consistent 40W. I can go on and on about other brands that I've tried. Switch to isocord ... its consistently gives me good results.

"Look high quality, easy to use in craft projects, small glitch...","These are beautiful butterflies with shear fabric, glitter around the edges, and gems for a body, antenna and as accents. The fabric is joined at the back in a bunch with a band of metal that forms a bit of a lump. A few of the butterflies needed to be shaped, but that was easily accomplished as they are a light wire frame. The only reason I did not give them higher stars is because several of the butterflies had gems that had come off them and had to be glued back on. I did not mind as I was using them in a craft project. What I did mind was that not all the missing gems were in the bag. I ordered two bags and was left with three butterflies that I could not use. The gems are easy enough to buy as they are a standard size and color, but I didn't want to put that much effort into replacing them. Overall, I am happy with my purchase and would buy them again, they are a good value and look like they are high quality not cheap.",4.0,1603054388596,Tegg Butterfly Decoration 20PCS Glitter Rhinestone Organza Wire Butterflies Craft Table Scatter for Party Wedding Card Scrapbook Craft,"Arts, Crafts & Sewing, Scrapbooking & Stamping, Scrapbooking Embellishments, Embellishments"

"Didn‚Äôt work for me, but my daughter liked it.","I ordered this because I thought it was really pretty and the fiber content made it sound desirable. When I received it, I still thought it was really pretty and it felt really nice. However, using it, I didn‚Äôt care for it very much. Keep in mind, when it comes to crochet I am not entirely well practiced anymore. But I wanted to give a simple project a go. I found this frustrating to work with, it just split constantly and since it‚Äôs been so long since I have worked with yarn I wasn‚Äôt up for the frustration. I would say that I‚Äôm maybe an advanced beginner at this point and this is probably not a beginner yarn. So I gave it to my oldest daughter, who has been knitting and crocheting as a hobby for quite a few years now, and she decided to have some fun with it and made herself a long sleeve crop top. She told me that she really liked it and had a nice texture and she really thought the coloring was well done and very beautiful. She thought it was pretty strong for how thin and loosely spun it was as well.

Top quality -- nice size to keep in a bathroom drawer.,"Excellent scissors for trimming loose threads, grooming nose and ear hairs, etc. I keep these in the drawer in the bathroom and use them all the time. If you need sewing scissors for plucking out tightly sewn threads, I would recommend getting a pair with a sharper point -- I really like this pair precisely because they do not have a super sharp point -- the point is just sharp enough to get into fairly tight places, but at the same time, it is not so sharp that it will poke and hurt you. In addition to having just the right shape of point for my uses,I found these to be very high quality -- they have precision cutting edges that cut cleaning -- in other words, if you cut a piece of paper it will cut easily rather than fold in the jaws of the scissors as happens with some poor quality scissors.",5.0,1461016647000,"Darice Micro Scissors Blister, 4-Inch","Arts, Crafts & Sewing, Crafting, Craft Supplies, Cutting Tools, Scissors"

Very difficult for a skill level 1 kit.,This is no way a basic kit for kids or scouts to build. We purchased four multi packs for our scout pack to build and the parents struggled to assemble the kits for our rocket night. This is not a basic assembly and should not be considered for a classroom event. Better to look at the UP rocket kit or the plastic snap together kits that are actually able to be assembled by the kids. Labeling this as a skill level 1 rocket kit is misleading and a dis-service. This kit actually is best built over the course of several days by experienced model builders.

Well Made Small 3-Hole Paper Punch At Bargain Price.,"This certainly does the job at a very affordable price if you want a 3-hole punch machine. To get a machine that will punch several times more than the 10-sheet capacity here one must really spend a lot more. Due to the quality to price ratio with the Swingline desktop model here I'm more than happy to punch 10-pages. The holes are made with slight effort and they're wonderfully clean (no chads) so within the relatively small number of pages per punch this is a good choice. Here's something interesting, the hole dies can be moved if you want a different format. You can even buy individual extra dies if you'd like. I'd just suggest buying an extra one of these to get 3 dies as when you buy the dies individually from Swingline they're about $30 per die. In fact I'm going to buy another one for this very reason.

"Wonderful cleaner, but doesn't last very long if you have a lot of jewelry.","This is pretty could stuff. However, I used previously their generic jewelry cleaner and now the 'silver' one. But it cleans a lot more than silver just fine, In fact, they both seem to work equally on all metals, the only difference between the two being the color. The only thing I don't like about it is that you can't clean brass, and sometimes it's hard to tell the difference between brass and copper and bronze. Overall a good, but if you get a lot of old jewelry, the liquid is going to become quite dirty fast and will lose some strength, which is why I took one star off. They need to add something to filter any buildup in the liquid, and perhaps they can send a small vile of some sort of concentrate to restore its strength.al But that's my only complaint. It really does a remarkable job.. To test that, you can compare this with the old metal-cleaning trick of placing aluminum foil on the bottom of a pan and filling it with salt and vinegar. That cleans any metal pretty well,but this works better, and no other liquid cleaner I have used beats that old fashion method except this.",4.0,1518713453590,"Polished Silver Jewelry Cleaner Kit - Professional Jewelry Cleaning in 1-Minute | Silver Cleaning Solution, Polishing Cloth + Anti-Tarnish Jewelry Bags | Made in USA + Best Sterling Silver Cleaner","Arts, Crafts & Sewing, Beading & Jewelry Making, Polishing & Buffing"

If you buy anything from Singer, you are faced with a complete lack of local customer service, except, perhaps, for the later-model sewing machines. I would never consider buying anything from Singer ever again unless there were a local or in-home service capability. And, given the poor reliability of the design of this particular unit, it is doubtful that I would ever buy anything made by this company for any reason, ever.",1.0,1448074010000,SINGER 1800 Watts 33 inch-Wide Rotary Steam Iron with 5 Temperature & 3 Steam Settings,"Arts, Crafts & Sewing, Singer, Garment Care"

Does not come in honey comb shape and quality isn't as good as I've had.,"Instead of getting a honey comb shaped block as shown in the picture, you get two sticks of wax. I've purchased beeswax locally and it smells more sweet and natural than this beeswax. For those two reasons I'm giving it 3 stars. Continually learning about beeswax, I learned about pesticides being sprayed in and around the hive, collecting in the wax which makes the wax not ideal (and probably not safe) for cosmetic use (i.e. homemade lotion or lip balm, made by mixing the wax with olive oil). The wax is advertised as ""Collected from unsprayed and unfertilized fields of wild flowers"", but it does not say if the hive itself is treated with pesticides. I emailed the company asking them if pesticides were used and if it's safe to use the wax for cosmetic purposes, but got no response. I can only assume the the difference in quality of smell with the wax I bought locally is because of the pesticides, plus when I use it as a lip balm I get a weird taste in my mouth. I would recommend looking for an organic beeswax if you plan on using it on your skin.",3.0,1265398672000,"Stakich Pure Yellow Beeswax Block - Natural, Cosmetic Grade - 1 Pound","Arts, Crafts & Sewing, Crafting, Candle Making, Wax"

The second picture is still in the shade but looking directly over it which is much more representative of the final color. I would have given five stars if the color had ended up more of a dark spruce blue/green I expected, but it covered well and does not look like it will crack. I followed the tip online to slightly wet the material before painting. It took four coats, and the coats went from yellow-green, to darker yellow-green, to more blue in the yellow green to the final result, so be patient with the applications to get the color you want.

I really wanted to work on my leather plaiting/braiding/knots for dog collars and leashes and I figured this was not the best quality, but it was cost effective to work on technique before I purchase more expensive materials. I could not even work on my technique because the leather cannot hold tension, light tension like to get a nice tight braid. I would not recommend this for braiding/plaiting/knot work for practice or a finished product it just is not a good quality product that you can get nice tight work with, it snaps or the dye cracks and looks horrible. I would return it if I could. On the plus side if you work with animals like Horses and worry about jewelry like a necklace or bracelet getting caught on the equipment or an animal grabbing it and pulling, this would snap very easily and I bet it would snap so easily that if you wanted to wear a bracelet or necklace it would be mostly safe due to the low stress snapping issue.

This is the WORST candle making wax that I've ever used.,"I've been making candles for twenty years, and I have NEVER bought a wax that had such disastrous results. First of all, it came in flakes, not pellets, and it flew all around the immediate area as I scooped it out of the bag. Secondly, it isn't made for candle making, as advertised, especially not free-standing columns like the ones that I produce. Candles come out looking as if they were mixed with solid white - so bright, clear colors aren't possible. Personally, if I want to make pastel candles, I want the result to be intentional. Thirdly, the wax can't hold a scent AT ALL, so all of the wonderful-smelling essential oils were wasted. As if those weren't enough negative features, the candles turned out feeling greasy, as though they had been drenched in oil and poorly wiped off.

Wrong color and defective! They had leaves in the bag for crying out loud!,"The second I recieved them, I could see little sead or leaves of some sort all in the bag, mixed in with the earrings.

I never even bothered counting them because if how terrible they looked. They also don't match the the color I ordered. I ordered the red copper looking ones and these are definitely more bronze. I ordered matching red copper jump rings for them and these don't match that color at all.
