"Brother makes great printers, but never trust their drums and toner.","It should be noted that I've owned at least 6 different Brother printers over the past few years for my business.

The original Brother drum was bad within 30 days of owning it, but once replaced with Japanese drum, after much trial and error, it fixed the problem. Gotta say it really pissed me off because the assumption with a new printer is that at least the drum should be reliable, but it took us awhile to diagnose the issue. We cleaned, tried new toner cartridges, and still couldn't figure it out, which necessitated unnecessary expenditures in addition to time.

Time will test durability and whether they're worth the $100.,"These boots feel very chunky and like they'd protect my ankles in a slide or crash of some kind. I like the idea of the armor over the ankle bone and the protective toe box. They are very cool looking, and the other colors I've seen have looked good. I have not had these nearly long enough to review durability, and looking at the construction I'm kind of nervous. I can see seams in the layers of rubber and leather, and tiny stitching holding together 2mm thick material. The laces and in sole are garbage, order new ones at the same time you order these boots. They run pretty true to size, so a good in sole will dial in fit for you. In my pair, there was something hard and sharp stuck between the inner lining and the leather which I found stabbing my pinky toe viciously while sitting at a red light on my motorcycle. That was a strange dance. For almost $100 I'd want some better padding inside, there is none at all.

"A solid all in one wax, but falls short of specialty products.","I've used a variety of Meguiars products from their simple consumer products to their various multi step professional products. Both are top notch, but there are differences in effort and results. This is the former, albeit trying to satisfy the wants of people who tend to use the latter. As an all in one wax, it tries to clean (surface imperfections--you must wash your car first) , polish, wax, and seal in one go. This is your traditional consumer wax product, aka a ""cleaner wax"". Pros tend to clean with a clay bar, use one or more polishes, follow with a natural wax, and lastly finish with a synthetic sealer. This can take an entire afternoon, but the results can be amazing. While a cleaner wax can largely replicate this lengthy process, the results will fall short--Meguars or not. Anyway, this is better than most consumer waxes, it goes on smooth, sets nicely, and it wipes off without too much work. It yields great, but not amazing results. The distinction is that the depth and ""wetness"" of the results fall short of a more hands on solution. This is due to the lack of a proper polish, which is the key to a lengthy detail, but a 30 minute wax vs a 4 hour experience is a fair tradeoff.",5.0,1559245651143,"Meguiar’s D16616 Ultra Polishing Wax, 16 Fluid Ounces","Automotive, Car Care, Exterior Care, Car Polishes & Waxes, Waxes"

Best hand squeegee that I've used so far.,"I've used three different hand squeeges now for wiping down glass panels and tile in my showers, and this one is the best. I can quickly squeegee the glass and leave no water behind. The only downside is that I've scratched my shower tiles a few times with the aluminum/steel, leaving tiny, barely noticeable scratches, but overtime, the scratches will accumulate and be noticeable. I like the handle size. With one of the other squeegees that I used, the handle was so short that I water would splash onto my hands as I squeegeed. Be careful not to bend the aluminum/steel. It was my fault- got it caught in a door while the door closed, and not I need to replace it. Still the best I've used, but I wish they would make a version that had plastic where the metal is currently.",5.0,1466978819000,IKEA - LILLNAGGEN Shower squeegee,"Health & Household, Household Supplies, Cleaning Tools, Squeegees"

I wanted a nice chrome finish plate frame that didn't look chunky or cover up the registration stickers like a lot of other frames do. I stuck two of these on my '68 Pontiac Tempest.

Don't work well until everything fully breaks in.,"***see update below*** I installed these on my car and did the break in procedure. Once they warm up during regular driving, their stopping power is amazing. But until they get warm, they actually perform worse than OEM. I don't feel too safe with them driving down the highway where they get the chance to cool down, losing braking power. Now, I don't know the culprit are the rotors or the pads. Since the composition of the pads are different than most generic ceramic pads, I'm going to go ahead and assume the culprit are the pads. ***update*** So, it takes a long time to beak in the rotors. The break in procedure brakes the pads in, but it took over a month for the rotors to fully break in to have a smooth surface and get rid of the crosshatch scratches from the factory. It took even longer for the rears to break in - two months. But not that everything is broke in, the brakes work extremely well.

However, this one doesn't really move much air either. It's simply physics. It has 10 blades which virtually fill the opening leaving little room for air to gain access. It actually works better on slow or medium which is fine with me. That's less power draw from the battery. I tapped directly into the ceiling light nearby and there was no significant power change when turning the lights and fan on and off. Very little power draw.

Sadly, I didn't do my normal research & check how much it was on Amazon or, more importantly, read any reviews. The cost of the machine itself is cheap, but the label ribbons are so pricey you think twice about labelling. In addition to the narrow margin & chain print functions (which you have to set EVERY time), another way I've managed to get more out of the label ribbon is by using the carriage return/ENTER key. I stack titles on top of one another to make the ribbon last longer. But again, you have to use scissors to trim the 2 separate lines in 1/2 - which defeats the purpose of having a label maker...

Weird Shape and Wing Location Didn't Work for Me.,"I see these got a lot of good reviews but Always Overnight Infinity pads didn't work well for me. The location of the stick on wings is very far forward which made it so I had to move the pad too far back (so I could wrap those wings through leg of underwear) to be effective, plus the middle/front end of the pad (where I need protection the most) is the narrow end and didn't have good coverage. Also, the sticky didn't stay down so the front part of the pad would often fold over toward the back while I was wearing them. I tried reversing the pad back to front and it worked better, with the wide part of the pad where I needed it up front, but that also tended to fold over because the sticky didn't keep it down.

All capsules are stuck together and rip apart when trying to remove a single one.,"This review relates to the details of my last shipment and not necessarily the effectiveness of the product. I have been using this product for a few months and have been liking the results. The last order, however, did not please me for multiple reasons. Since I ordered last month the price increased $3, but I was going on a short vacation over the weekend and was nearly out so I placed the order so I would have it for the weekend. When I opened the bottle at the hotel and tried to shake out a couple of capsules nothing happened. It was then that I realized that all of the capsules were stuck together in one big mass. I am able to remove a couple at a time but the sometimes the capsules rip and cause the contents to spill. After I removed a couple of pills and try to swallow them they are sticky and cause problems for me because these are about the largest pills I can swallow. The extra stickiness just causes more issues. I am assuming this is just a bad bottle that I received and hopefully the next one will not have any issues.",1.0,1565723295979,"Nature's Bounty L-Carnitine 400 mg & ALA 200 mg, 30 Capsules","Health & Household, Vitamins, Minerals & Supplements, Amino Acids, Acetyl-L-Carnitine"

If you're a side or stomach sleeper, you won't be able to comfortably rest the side of your head against the pillow because the memory foam part of the mask is WAY too bulky and thick. 2. If you sleep flat on your back, the stiff and scratchy straps make a substantial lump at the back of your head that is very uncomfortable - and gave me quite a headache. 3.

Clumsy design and one wing broke off inside the wall.,"I'm experienced with installing products in the home, but I had trouble with this mount design. One of the two wing fasteners broke off in the wall when the screw failed to engage the threads for some reason. It was still usable to mount the grab bar, but certainly not as strong as it should be since only one side of the fastener functioned properly. It is all made of plastic and costs too much to buy a spare. The assembly process is rather clumsy because you have to snap the wings into the base yourself - something that should have been done at the factory in my opinion. If it goes in right, the Wingits fastener is strong enough, however. I also used the Moen Secure Mount system for a different grab bar and found the Moen superior to this mount.",2.0,1410911638000,WingIts RC-RESGBW35-2 Grab Bar Anchor,"Medical Supplies & Equipment, Mobility & Daily Living Aids, Bathroom Safety, Aids & Accessories, Bath & Shower Aids, Bath & Shower Grab Bars"

Works but BLACK is printed as Dark Green!  NOT WORTH BUYING!,"As expected, the printer utility did not recognize the ink level status and claimed the replacement ink cartridge was empty.

"It works for my needs, but I wouldn't clean a fine crystal decanter with it.","I purchased this product so that I could use it to clean my 1 qt bormioli swing cap bottles. The cleaner I wanted was on back order and I had a deadline. In the picture this product looks like it is very supple. Actually it is not at all. It is very hard and the tip has a fold on it which made it impossible to get into my bottles until I made a very simple modification. Just use some pliers and undo the fold. After that it works pretty well. If I had a very fine class decanter I do not believe I would use this to clean it because it is too hard, but for some sturdy bormioli swing cap bottles that I use to make sodas, well it's just about right. It would be really awesome if they would replace the metal with a more flexible plastic so it will be more supple like it seems in the picture.",3.0,1358742422000,"Oenophilia Decanter Cleaning Brush, Multi-functional, Flexible Scourer, Glassware Wine Brush, Great for Narrow Neck Wine Decanters","Health & Household, Household Supplies, Cleaning Tools, Brushes"

They sent the wrong item for my wife's Christmas present...,"My wife and I were just married Dec 8th and it's our first Christmas as a married couple... I ordered the Mastex Professional Heated Booties for her, gift-wrapped by Amazon. I received the package and put it under the tree (again, it's gift-wrapped so I had no idea it was the wrong item at this point). Today was a bit chilly and very windy outside, so I built her a fire and told her she could open one present early (like we always did in my home as a kid). I gave her the ;booties ; to keep her feet warm while we snuggle up and watch a movie together, but when she opens them, it turns out Amazon sent me the Hand warmers from Mastex instead by mistake. I double-checked my order, and I did order the right thing. Now, there is no way to get the booties before Christmas. On the upside, she loved that I ordered her heated booties and thinks she'll use the hand warmers as well. So I've decided to make lemons into lemonade by keeping the hand warmers and ordering the booties to arrive after Christmas to make the set complete. Once the booties arrive, I'll change my review to represent the quality and functionality of the actual product I ordered. Until then, I thought 2 stars was fair... Hopefully, Amazon (or Mastex) will decide to do the right thing and discount one (or both) of the orders I've placed with them.

In any case, take your time, preparation is key.

Phone Poorly Designed and Tough to Use - Shame on AT&T.,Nothing should be simpler than building a quality cordless phone - they have been around forever and everyone who makes them should know what features customers want. Maybe I am spoiled by the intuitive functions and elegant design of the iPhone and expect to see some of that in other electronic products but this was not the case with the AT&T cordless phone. Considering the price of this phone it should offer easier to use features and better design. The phone's surface is very smooth and slippery which leads to easily dropping the phone or having it slide in your hand. The buttons are poorly designed and you must press each one slowly and firmly to have the number register - no fast dialing with this phone. The phone base does not have a good design - when placing it on the base to charge - it is easily knocked over and the phone must be carefully placed in the narrow charging port so that it doesn't fall off the base.

Rickety but they all seem to be. Works fine. Keep a screwdriver handy.,"This was very useful and well worth the money. The height adjustment is clever because the poppet things that attach the arms to the bar at the back have freedom to turn up or down a bit - the holes are oval so longer up and down than they are wide. So even though you adjust the height to the nearest inch, the front floor pads always touch the floor exactly. The arms seem safe but are a bit rickety because the two parts of each arm wiggle. That's because the holes for the poppet things where they join together are bigger than needed. The manufacturer could have done a more exact job sizing them but probably opted for ease of assembly when you line the poppet up with the hole. The bar at the back fastens between the toilet and seat using the long plastic bolts that are already part of the toilet seat. However, because the frame is rickety, all the wobbling back and forth makes the toilet seat bolts loosen after several days, so you need to check them regularly and tighten them with a screwdriver if necessary.",4.0,1456416989000,Drive Medical Toilet Safety Frame,"Medical Supplies & Equipment, Mobility & Daily Living Aids, Bathroom Safety, Aids & Accessories, Toilets & Toilet Aids, Toilet Safety Frames & Rails"

The worst mouse and scanner at the same time.,"This amazing device provides the absolute worst of both worlds. It's a slippery-surfaced mouse that feels downright awful in the hand, and a scanner that can barely function. At best, interesting to play with. Once you get past the novelty, you're left with an awful scanner that can take several passes to get a single flat sheet correctly seamed together. And don't even think of scanning out of a bound book, it will slip off of one edge on one side and bump into the binding on the other. Any removal of the mouse from the scanned surface will confuse the scanning software and force you to start over. For half the price, you could get a Cannon flatbed that is the same size as a laptop. If you're really desperate for a scan, scanner software that runs on the iPhone does well with with the build-in camera, too. These far better options have left my LG scanner mouse completely unused.

Perfect for winter and summer.,I came here to buy another one for our other car and was sad to see this product was no longer available... It does a great job keeping frost off in the winter.

"OK, but the Golden Valley brand Organic is better.","I bought this product and the Golden Valley Natural Organic (Original) in order to compare them. They're exactly the same price per ounce (the Golden Valley product is organic; the John Wayne organic is more expensive). They're similar, both fall into the ""soft"" beef jerky category with no artificial ingredients. However, the John Wayne product is a bit mealy and has a subtle but funny aftertaste. This outweighs the single shortcoming of the Golden Valley product, which is that it is a bit too sweet.",3.0,1323444257000,"John Wayne Organic Beef Jerky, Original, 3-Ounce Bags (Pack of 8)","Health & Household, Diet & Sports Nutrition, Sports Nutrition"

"Great ingredients and soft feel, but not a smooth wipe.","I like that the ingredients doesn't list methylisothiazolinone or methylchloroisothiazolinonm, which are preservatives that have been linked with contact sensitization (i.e., allergic reactions with regular, repeated use). Each sheet has just the right amount of moisture and is tear resistant. The light baby powder smell is pleasant. The added aloe is also welcomed, though I wish they also included witch hazel in the ingredients. Nevertheless, I did not rate this a perfect 5 stars because I do not like the texture of the wipes. While indeed it does feel soft, the surface is a bit too fibrous and thus rougher than I would like. It's similar in texture to the moist tissues by Cottonelle or Charmin. For a smoother wipe that includes witch hazel, I would look to getting Wet Ones instead.",4.0,1408389422000,"Fresh N' Up Adult Moist Toilet Tissue, Travel/Refill Pop-Up Dispensing, 42-Count Packages (Pack of 12)","Health & Household, Household Supplies, Tissues, Toilet Paper & Sprays, Personal Cleansing Wipes"

Not a Good Label Maker at All!,"I always loved making labels like the ones you can make with this label maker but I found this one problematic. It's super tricky to feed the tape into the label maker. You have to actually punch a letter or number in order for it to feed through, meaning you are stuck with one or two extra characters before the word you want to type. Second, the tape does not stick! Any labels I put on my folder FELL OFF. The tape isn't sticky at all. Also, there is no SPACE and you have to use a capital I for the number 1 and an O for a zero. Not good at all. Wouldn't recommend to anybody.",1.0,1551814680809,K&CompanySMASH Label Maker,"Office Products, Office Electronics, Other Office Equipment, Label Makers"
