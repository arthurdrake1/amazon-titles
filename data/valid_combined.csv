"ETH, not really a slushy. Add was misleading.","Three stars because this came fast, the first of many items I had ordered. But the item itself, was a dissapointment. In the add, a kid puts the ice cubes in the freezer, then takes it out, fills it with juice, inserts the cubes and shakes, and then VOILA! A slushy. That was a tall tale. I Put the ice cubes in as the kid did, put them in the cup after filling it with juice (which was a REAL waste of it) and shook it for a long time. After opening the top, to suprise was juice with some cold spots on the top, not a slushy.

This is the perfect protection for a full-sized back seat pick-up cab!,"I love this product. I have been using a car protection ""hammock"", or ""sling"" for many years, and it's ok, but the straps didn't last very long before rotting out and it didn't provide full coverage for the whole bench. It also blocked air circulation from vents. This one was purchased for a pick-up truck with full sized back seat cab and leather seats. I knew I wanted something that would be a great fit, have a mesh opening to allow for cool air circulation, and would have full coverage and a material with some ""padding"" to hopefully protect the seats best from dirt on outer edges, and scratches or punctures from dog's nails. This is a PERFECT fit, and it looks sharp too.

The only mouse-pad I will ever want to use.,"Being a programmer, I spend a lot of time on the computer, and supporting my wrist is important. I have tried many mouse-pads, and was never satisfied with any others than the Gel-eez mouse pad. The padding for the wrist is very comfortable, it feels soft but yet gives your wrist strong support. The problem with other mouse-pads is, that they have too little wrist support, and also that the pad where the mouse is on does not work well: With a laser mouse, you will sometimes encouter problems due to reflections of the surface the mouse it laying on. This was the case for a Belkin mouse-pad I tried. The Gel-eez mouse-pad works perfectly in that aspect.

A small whiff is all that's needed for a calming experience.,"This fragrance mist is interesting.....and long lasting. There are times when some help is needed to corral any stressful feelings that might occur during the course of the day, or to assist with relaxing sleep. So far, I've done one small spritz on the inside of my arm to see how it reacts with my skin, and how long the scent lasts. The fragrance of sweet flowers is right there, along with some natural woodsy and citrusy notes. All-in-all a nice combination. It's a bit strong but not objectionable (only 1 spritz!). My concern would be if any of the essential oils might possibly stain any fabrics - clothing, bedding. I'm thinking that a cloth hanky might be a good vehicle to carry this calming aroma close by, ready when needed.

It's the wrong picture - cheap plastic no spring included.,"It's so frustrating when vendors on Amazon put the wrong picture and limited description.

I was hoping to get a high quality sealed metal refill that fit perfectly, but instead was sent 10 plastic refills without a notch for the spring and it didn't include a spring like in the picture.

Junk!  Prints color pictures in a faded green color!  Noisy!,Don't buy this printer! 1) Yes the ink is cheaper.

It just has a piece of shiny metal inside. I can't imagine it would cost that much to put some basic reflector there. - since this case is single-walled as opposed to the double walled larger cases, it's a little more flexible.

Pilot Varsity pens are a great option if you want to try out fountain pens.,"or better pens for smoothness or build quality, but are a great place to start.

At my desk at home though, I use the Pilot Metropolitan or otherwise. They do use a lot of ink though, which causes two considerations. First, you'll have to use good paper, or only use one side of the sheet. If you use cheaper paper notebooks or pads, it will bleed through and make it nearly illegible if you use both sides. Even the premium Moleskine's just barely show through but are completely usable. Secondly, you'll want a couple spares, as by page 60 in an Moleskine large book, I've usually exhausted one of the pens ink supply.

"Good shredder, small container but very strong and quiet.","Product works very well. Shreds quite a thickness of paper at one time and does so at a relatively quiet noise level. The only 2 things that could be considered negative is the container/basket size and the actual paper feed function.

Being that my community recycles shredded paper, this ends up being more convenient than that of my old shredder... which was much bigger. The paper feed mechanism requires somewhat of a firm paper to initiate the shredding. (Trying to send in one receipt at a time doesn't always trigger the shredder to start shredding.)

Easy Solution For 2001 Toyota Avalon with misfiring issues.,"Easy and affirdable solution for my sons 2001 Toyota Avalon. It was running very rough.

So THIS is what oil-of-oregano REALLY smells and tastes like?!  *LOL*.,"I have to say that this is an amazing product. It is so bizarre to actually taste and smell PURE oil-of-oregano, but the feeling of this very powerful product--mixed in a 2:1 ratio with non-GMO/organic extra-virgin olive-oil--on my skin was really something else amazing.

I will need to take it internally when I become ill, and this seems fine, THUS FAR, for external use, but should I further dilute it when taking it internally? I would always take six-eight drops twice per day of the Source Naturals Wellness Oil-of-Oregano, and that appears to be in a nearly 2:1 ratio; HOWEVER, the carvacrol content of that oil-of-oregano was only at 70%, while this is between 83-85%, which is SUBSTANTIALLY more potent.

Very accurate but steel grip tough for heavy bags.,"Hi, I bought this for weighing bags in the US, for trips within and outside the US. Simple. There is nothing complicated about this, and I am very happy with the purchase. I use it about once a month. I have two complaints: the grip to hold up the scale is a steel C-shaped grip and its not the most convenient. Its actually quite tough to squeeze more than 3 fingers in, and then my 3 fingers get crushed in it. Its possible, make no mistake, but its just not pleasant.

Great Taste... but not a great source of fiber.,"The good news is that Benefiber tastes great - In fact, it tastes a bit like a piece of orange soda candy! It is very easy to take without water and leaves little after-taste. What more could you want? Unfortunately, Benefiber only supplies 3 grams of fiber per serving..which is three tablets. To put this in perspective a piece of whole wheat bread supplies about the same level of fiber. To put it in perspective: -Recommended dose 9 tablets (Which would still supply less than 50% of recommended daily needs) -At 9 tablets per day each bottle would last for 11 days - Daily cost ... about $1.00 per day -  One thing about most types of orange candy is that it is pretty cheap- Benefiber tastes like candy...but it is not cheap, and still falls far short of what we need in our daily diet.",3.0,1204850049000,"Benefiber Nutriouse Orange Creme Chewable Tablet, 100 Tablets (Pack of 2)","Health & Household, Vitamins, Minerals & Supplements, Digestive Supplements, Dietary Fibers"

That being the case, I replaced the 3 non-black cartridges and am back in black-only-printing business. This may be standard operating procedure for printers these days, but is just new to me.

Fits and works identically to the OEM original in my Dell 1320c laser.,"I was searching for an alternative to Dell's $75 replacement cartridge for my Dell 1320c printer, and found this and decided it was worth a try.

Thin Protective Sleeves for US Paper Currency... It's OK So Far.,"I was looking for mylar sleeves for my paper currency, but found these to be much cheaper (and thinner).

"They fit, but they are low hangers/no support for warranty or parts.","These fit fine, although I don't have the front support since I waited nearly 5 months before I was able to get them installed. The bolt thing you put into the front hole for the support arm to the side of the mounting arm is missing for 1 side and it takes 2 so I had to remove it due to flex so as not to damage it. If I can get another of these bolt things, whatever they're called since I can't figure out what they're called and can't locate another one i'll reinstall them. But i'll have to do a slight lift on my truck as with them installed there is very little ground clearance as my truck's current height. I probably will have to do a 3 inch lift on the front and 1 inch on the rear since it's down so low and i'm afraid these will drag. So, find that part whatever it is and get a lift kit installed and maybe I can actually put these on. IF I don't locate another type I like better and just stick these in a yard sale or something. Edit: I can't find who to contact for parts or even the warranty if I needed to anywhere on this site. There isn't a link. And the seller on Amazon NEEDS a parts/warranty link added on here so we can get support since no one has even replied to this message in weeks so far.

Focus ST Air Filter is just SO.,"Well, first of all, this is just another oiled air filter just like K&N. For a 18 Focus ST, its fitment is just pretty good. They give you a clamp to install it, but it really does not do anything because there is not enough flange on the stock air box to clamp onto. I see people saying this thing really increases the sound of the Turbo, if you still have your symposer hooked up, you don't hear anything more than you did before. I really am not interested in an oiled air filter because the filter oil almost ALWAYS ends up contaminating the Mass Air Flow Sensor, so this thing is going back as I am opting for a dry filter. It does, fit the stock air cleaner box fairly well and it appears and feels like a quality part, but it is just another K&N style oiled cotton filter.",3.0,1551877932901,Green Filter 7159 Green High Performance Air Filter,"Automotive, Replacement Parts, Filters, Air Filters & Accessories, Air Filters"

The last two bottles I purchased are water thin. When I pour it from the measuring cap there is no residue left behind. That's how watery it is now and taking a full measuring cap has no effect on me. They ruined a good product.,2.0,1530920309701,"GoodSense Milk of Magnesia Original, Saline Liquid Laxative for Constipation Relief, 12 oz","Health & Household, Health Care, Over-the-Counter Medication, Digestion & Nausea, Laxatives"

No Stars. Absolutely the Worst Piece of Junk Furniture I have Ever Bought.,Product was delivered in good order. That is the only good thing I have to say about this piece of garbage. The material is flimsy and too light. I put a peg right through the File Drawer just by pushing it in. I patched the Drawer with Laminate and assembled anyway. Big mistake. Now that it is assembled and I no longer have the box I have no way to return it. The drawers do not line up quite right. Th File Cabinet door keeps falling off when you open it.

If your turn signal needs to be as bright as a star - get these.,I replace every light in my car with LEDs - just prefer the color and brightness. But as with all fun car stuff - the mechanical switching of the turn signal oscillators in my truck are impedance sensitive. This means the turn signal flashes like a madman because the resistance is so low in these chips. You can fix this with a DIY resistor added to the line - but then you have to splice factory wire. Or you can buy a 50 dollar dongle per light to do the same thing. The fact JDM did not impedance match the normal bulbs with this in mind is unfortunate. That is the only reason for the reduced star. But personally - I like the nervous turn signal. These people need to know I intend to turn and the dang thing is a bright orange strobe light.

Not as strong as the cream and still smells.,"I would recommend sticking with the normal icy hot cream if your looking for real relief. The first time i used this it worked pretty well but after that it was pretty much only good for tearing off hair. The smell is still present with the patch so your not gaining much and it can be rather difficult to apply to your own back. But after the 2nd time i used it, it didn't feel like it did anything. The active ingredients aren't as strong as the normal icy hot cream. Bottom line, stick to the normal extra strength cream if you are looking for an effective product and if your worried about the smell well then stick to real ice and a heating pad.

Not Direct Replacement but does work. Japan got it right. China made it cheap.,The description makes it sound like a direct bolt up. Here is the rub. Remove the heavy duty bolts designed in Japan and install the cheap ball studs from China. Look at the photos. The OEM has a heavy duty bolt that the strut rides on.

Will do the job but not a premium fit or feel.,"The look and fit of the front mats are good, but the back larger mat needs some work. The sides of the mat need some sort of interlocking or ;snap together ; feature so that it fits tighter to the stow and go bucket seats (2017 Dodge Grand Caravan).

Perhaps a redesign would help this mat overall. I agree with the other reviewers that mentioned the thinness of the material. I had some Husky brand mats in my last car that were much thicker and heavy duty. Not that these won't do the job, but they aren't as nice as the Husky mats, or Weather Tech, which is reflected in the cheaper price, of course.

But it does start writing immediately unlike the Cross, and I've had far fewer problems w/it than w/the Cross pen. The only big drawback is the barrel - it's a little wider than I like it. Now while it's true that the narrower the barrel, the easier it is to get writer's cramp, the wider barrel doesn't suit me because I have small hands, but it's just a personal quirk of mine. Certainly everyone has different levels of comfort concerning a writing instrument. If your hands are small, you might find it less ergonomical and might have trouble writing for long periods of time w/this pen. Overall, I like this pen and would recommend it.
