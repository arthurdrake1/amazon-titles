# amazon-titles

Meta Llama 2 and Llama 3 fine-tuned using QLoRA on a subset of the [Amazon Reviews '23 dataset](https://amazon-reviews-2023.github.io/) to generate titles using Amazon review data.

Models available on Hugging Face: [Llama 2](https://huggingface.co/adrake17/Meta-Llama-2-7B-Chat-Amazon) and [Llama 3](https://huggingface.co/adrake17/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Amazon). Warning: model card unfinished.

This repo includes the main experimental notebook and utils.py helper code. It also contains the final processed data subsets used for training and evaluation.
